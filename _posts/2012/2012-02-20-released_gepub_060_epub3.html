<p>Released <a href="http://github.com/skoji/gepub">new version of gepub</a>. gepub is a generic EPUB parser/generator for Ruby. Its main focus is to handle metadata in EPUB.<br />
New features in version 0.6.0 includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>supports EPUB3. It can(or should) handle every metadata defined in <a href="http://idpf.org/epub/30/spec/epub30-publications.html">EPUB Publications 3.0</a>. </li>
<li>Parse existing EPUB files.</li>
<li>New easy-to-use EPUB generating interface.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please check the readme and examples on the <a href="http://github.com/skoji/gepub">github repository</a> for more information.<br />
The original goal of gepub was to be a  'good-enough' EPUB generator. But, if you set a goal like 'good-enough', it will be rearly enough. gepub 0.5.0 has very poor functionality on handling metadata, no parsing, and only supports EPUB2.0.<br />
Now, the new goal of the library is to be a 'generic' EPUB library.  It's not generic enough and not stable yet, but I'm willing to make it enough and stable.</p>
